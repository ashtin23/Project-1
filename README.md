# Project-1
## Musical Trivia
A multiple choice trivia game based on music! Click the Start button to begin. Choose the best answer from the listed options and click on the corresponding button. Answer all 5 questions correctly to ace the challenge!
## Installation/Getting Started
1) Fork and clone this repository.
2) Change into the new directory.
3) Fulfill the listed requirements.
## User Stories
When approaching this project, I organized desired features into three levels, which are as follows:
1) Bronze Level: This is essentially the bare-bones functionality I was hoping to achieve. When prompted, the user is able to navigate through the quiz by clicking on provided buttons. Currently, my application is still within the bronze level. 
2) Silver Level: This plan includes adding more styling to the page, as well as improving functionality. Though I have yet to complete it, I am hoping to add images to applicable buttons. I am also going to have a title page, rather than just having a button on the first page. I am also going to incorporate the score counter onto each slide, to let the user know how many questions they have gotten correct as they make their way through the quiz. I am also going to add many more questions to the quiz.
3) Gold Level: My gold level is going to incorporate elaborate design on the title page and more elegant transitions between the slides. It is also going to introduce elements in-between each slide that informs them whether or not they answered the previous question correctly. It will also include quizzes with varying degrees of difficulty.
## Example
### Upon opening the application, you will see the title page, as follows:
